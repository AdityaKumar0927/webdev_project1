        <h2>2D Animation</h2>
        <p>
            In my freshman year of highschool, my parents bought me an ipad, so I began sketching characters on procreate and they had recently launched the new feature for animation, so I began to make traditional frame-by-frame
            animated videos. Then I got tired for animating every frame again and again, though it was still easier for me to animate given I had more advanced tools on procreate compared to doing it on paper. 
            Then I came across toon boom harmony and bought their software, which is an industry-grade software (rick & morty was made on it). 
            I learned how to rig characters on Toon Boom Harmony and even full 360 view characters and animate them for various projects- for instance, during highschool I made a video explaining the value of pi 
            and how to calculate the area of a circle by rigging an animated teacher and doing a voice over. Toon Boom harmony provides the tools to make the voice over more human-like by connecting the lip sync to certain
            mouth positions, and then automates the task for syncing character's mouth movements to my voice over, which is pretty cool.
